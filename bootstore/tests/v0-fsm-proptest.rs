//! Property based tests for bootstore scheme v0 protocol logic
//!
//! These tests operate by setting up a testbed of FSMs and triggering them
//! to exchange messages via API calls. The API calls are triggered via test
//! generated `Action`s. We check properties to validate correctness at various
//! stages of action processing such as after an FSM API gets called, and after
//! all generated messages have been delivered to the subset of reachable peers.
