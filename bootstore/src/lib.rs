//! The two communication paths for the bootstore:

//! RSS -> Sled Agent -> Coordinator -> Storage Nodes
//! Nexus -> Steno -> Sled Agent -> Coordinator -> Storage Nodes

//! Since some trust quorum membership information that is input via RSS must
//! make its way into CockroachDb so that reconfiguration works, we will load
//! that information from the trust quorum database, parse it, and write
//! it to CockroachDB when we start it up.
